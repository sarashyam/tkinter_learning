# tkinter_learning
This repository contains the codes and the challenges I've completed while learning tkinter GUI 
It has the slider , grid , gui resizer etc challenges and the tutorial code too
I've done all this from the help of a Youtube channel " Code with Harry" 
without any doubt he is good tutor more than that he uses common local language which makes it 
more understandable for the begginers. Thats not it I should'nt miss this , that he is a awesome coder which has alot of knowledge
